                We have partnered with service providers who offer government backed carbon offsetting programmes. 
                We use an extraction of the <strong>ISO 14064</strong> and <strong>GHG Emissions</strong> Protocol Accounting Standards to calculate the correct level carbon emission. 
                The GHG Protocol refers to a family of greenhouse gas accounting and reporting standards and guidelines. 
                It launched in 2001 with the groundbreaking Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard. 
                Each is rigorously developed by global multi-stakeholder partnerships of businesses, NGOs, governments and other bodies, convened by the World Resources Institute and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development.
